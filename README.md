# IndoorAirQualityMonitor
An indoor air quality monitor that uses a DFRobot CO2 Sensor and a BME280 Environment Sensor. Together these sensors will provide, CO2 concentration, temperature, air pressure and humidity readings, which will be locally available on an OLED display and will be accessible over the internet through a Grafana dashboard.
